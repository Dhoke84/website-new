              <h3>2. Assessments</h3>
              <p>
                alfarah relies on the usage of standardized assessment tools that are well known worldwide in the field of child development and learning career. The assessments are considered a core demand to decide therapy needs prior to intervention and they are also used for re-testing to monitor therapy gains and progress.  Following the assessment, a formal report is issued and a feedback meeting with parents takes place to reach a mutual understanding of the support plan that suits the child the best, based on the outcomes and recommendation of the assessment. The available battery of assessments covers the fields of emotional-behavioural wellbeing, cognitive abilities, psychoeducational profile, motor skills, sensory integration, and language abilities.  Below is a list of the currently used assessment tools.
